# Map Storymaker explanation.

The Map Storymaker will be an online tool for easily integrating user supplied multimedia into a map widget, adding spatial context to a series of descriptions or events. Each piece of media, whether it's a paragraph of text, an image or even a video, will be given an independent map coordinate as well as being being indexed as a member of the larger collection. This will help to situate the story fragments in space and time relative to one another, and add an extra layer of depth and interactivity to the story being told. The site will allow the user to save their map stories in the cloud, as well as providing access to embeddable code in the spirit of open source. Light customization and theming of the stories will be possible through provided tools, but the preferred approach to customization will be to demystify the generated code and encourage hacking.
